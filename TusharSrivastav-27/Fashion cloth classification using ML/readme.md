# Fashion_Cloth_Classification Uing ML
In this project Fashion_Cloth_Classification I have have used Fashion MNIST Dataset to train my model which will classify the cloths by taking it's image.Here I have kept my model name as fashion.h5.

It works according to the table given by MNIST_Fashion:

Table:-

0 ->	    T-shirt/top

1 ->	    Trouser

2 ->	    Pullover

3 ->	    Dress

4 ->	    Coat

5 ->	    Sandal

6 ->	    Shirt

7 ->	    Sneaker

8 ->	    Bag

9 ->	    Ankle boot

This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images.

*Our model will show (0)if it predicts that the cloth is T-shirt/top, it will show (1) if it predicts it is trouser and like that.*
